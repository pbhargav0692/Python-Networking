The client code does either listen to incoming messages from the server or check user input.
If the user types in a message then send it to the server.

We use select() function to handle both messages: one from stdin which is a user input and the other from the server.
As we recall, the server side usage which is a non-blocking mode, we don't do anything on the select() function, and we use it as blocking mode.
So, the select() function blocks (waits) till something happens.
It will return only when either the server socket receives a message or the user enters a message.
